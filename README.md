## Contributing

If you can't tell already, the UwUinator is not very well optimized and is somewhat messy. Fortunately, the UwUinator relies on the drive it's writing to for its speed. If there is any way you can think of making it faster or more optimized, feel free to fork it, make a PR, whatever.
